# RagsToRiches journey
## Wise quote from my Project guide : Every Expert was once a beginner..
Any code, Description, training time exercises etc during my coding journey...
This should serve like my own journey log.. Starting 18/03/2025 in poor academic, merit condition, aim to improve in 2 months+ counting
* 18/03/25: Beginning
* 20/03/25: Matrix Class Beginning 
* 24/03/2025: 8Q Problem work, cpp rev
* 28/03/2025: Revival after rest, but streak broken
* 4/4/2025: Blueprint for CPP Complex class, Root Finding, Curve Fitting etc (conceptual revision)
  > Mathematical concepts, CPP implementation side by side (plan till 6/4/25 ) Deadline breached 
  > JS Project (Crowd Management) JS Basics and Advanced Parallely
* 8/4/25: 10% Blueprint ready, JS Project and cpp class lagging
  > Next deadline 10/04/2025 : JS APIs working, ready for deployment, CPP Matrix class working (work continuously on complex, root and chebyshev concepts);
  > 11/04/2025 : Official (two practical Sessions' worth required)
  > Both Deadlines missed, need to turn this around is urgent and important, cluster work also to catch up with
* 12/4/25: 20% Blueprint ready, JS Project and cpp class lagging- Use extra time on 13th and 14th 
  > Next deadline 15/04/2025 : JS all APIs designed and working, (you be) ready for deployment, 
  > CPP Matrix class working (work continuously on complex, root and chebyshev concepts, coz in 20% time you have to do 220% just to catch up; meaning one task a       time, no room for parallels. STRICTLY.
